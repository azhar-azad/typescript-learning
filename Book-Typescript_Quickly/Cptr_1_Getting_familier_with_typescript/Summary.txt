TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. A program written in TypeScript has to be
transpiled into JavaScript first, and then it can be executed in the browser or a
standalone JavaScript engine.

Errors are caught by the TypeScript static code analyzer as you type, even before
you compile code with the Typescript compiler (tsc).

TypeScript gives you the benefits of statically typed languages when and where
you want it, without stopping you from using the good old dynamic JavaScript
objects when you want them.

TypeScript follows the latest specifications of ECMAScript and adds to them
types, interfaces, decorators, class member variables (fields), generics, enums,
the keywords public , protected , and private , and more. Check the Type-
Script roadmap at https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap
to see what’s available now and what’s coming in future releases of TypeScript.

To start a new TypeScript project, run the command tsc --init in any direc-
tory. It’ll create the tsconfig.json file for you, containing all the compiler’s
options with most of them commented out. Uncomment them as needed.
